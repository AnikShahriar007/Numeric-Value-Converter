# Numeric-Value-Converter
# Python Script

A simple Python script for converting numerical values.
This script is used for converting all the four numerical values (Decimal, Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal). One value can be converted to other formats. Four classes have been created for the four numerical values. They can used in other scripts. Feel free to change and use it anyway you like.

# Please Note: This script was written in Python 2.7 . But this isn't too different from Python 3. So changes can be made easily.
